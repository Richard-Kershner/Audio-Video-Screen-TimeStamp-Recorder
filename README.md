# Audio-Video-Screen-TimeStamp-Recorder

## This upload is for the purpose of helping others explore autio video syncronized recording from multiple sources
### The design is to have a timestamp file which is used to sync the audio video files
### Combine_sync_aud_vid.py runs seperately
#### Path is hardcoded and has to be changed for each date recorded, currently
#### Plan to upgrade so has call from main user GUI and pushes path
###
## Currently not built for deployment.  
### Functionailty of selecting which device is hardcoded.  Reboot of windows resets these paramters
#### Complete rebuild did away of the UI interface that allowed selection.  Might rebiuld at a later date
###
### Screen capture will be added back in at a later date as I do need that
### 
## Secondary purpose is for sharing my scripting abilities.
